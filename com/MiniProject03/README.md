#**📘 AlgorithmToolkit – Mini Project 3**

A lightweight Java utility library that consolidates essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) patterns into a reusable toolkit.
This project implements sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, generic collections, and benchmarking utilities — all structured into clean, well-documented, modular Java classes.

##**🚀 Project Objective**

To develop a consolidated Algorithmic Toolkit that demonstrates core DSA concepts, clean coding practices, modularization, and algorithm efficiency analysis.
##**🧠 Features
🔹1. SortingUtil**

Implements four sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Each method includes:

Method documentation

Time and space complexity notes

Test cases

##🔹 2. SearchUtil

Includes:

Linear Search

Binary Search

With:

Javadoc comments

Complexity notes

Test cases

##🔹 3. CollectionUtil (Generic)

Implements simplified generic:

Stack (push, pop, peek, isEmpty)

Queue (enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty)

##🔹 4. AnalysisUtil

A benchmarking helper utility:

timer(Runnable task) – Measures execution time of any algorithm

Supports lambda functions

Prints execution duration in milliseconds

##🧪 Test Cases

Each method across all classes includes at least two test cases, covering:

Sorting with repeated elements

Searching for existing & non-existing values

Stack/Queue operations

Performance measurement
